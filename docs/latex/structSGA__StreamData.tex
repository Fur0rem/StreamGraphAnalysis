Blanket struct that serves as a placeholder for the union of all stream types (Full\+Stream\+Graph, Link\+Stream, etc...). Otherwise a circular dependency would be created since these files need \doxylink{stream_8h}{stream.\+h}. It is safe to cast this to the actual type of the \doxylink{structStream}{Stream} (which is known in the \doxylink{structStream}{Stream} struct).
