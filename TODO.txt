- Clean up walks source code cause it is soooooo ugly
- Skip n for iterators
- Better error messages
- Name coherency between FSG/FullStreamGraph ect...
- Name guard for different iterators of the different stream types
- Check for data coherence in the input file
- Automate tests and formatting using GitHub actions
- Put NO_FREE next to its related structures and also have one name for destroy/free
- Benchmarking framework
- Change mallocs to the safe macro MALLOC defined in utils.h
- Add a config file for changing the default values and types used (for example slices, to fine tune the memory usage)
- Make sure every function and struct is prefixed with `SGA` to avoid name collisions
- Make sure the .h files are well guarded
- Make sure the .h files are included in the .c files
- Document the code
- Verify catch implementations for all functions
- const qualifier when needed
- Version control for formats
- Add format B where it's node by node instead of event by event
- Crashes when node ids not sorted in the input file
- Uniforming code for tests
- StreamData* back into void*
- Scaling -> Timescale
- Separate the example stream data from the tests
- Read all the TODOs in the code
- data_access for key_instants + induced_graph -> time_access
- Automatic initialisation of key instants table and events
- @param[in/out/in,out] for documentation
