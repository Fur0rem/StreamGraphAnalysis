- Add external format support for stream graphs
- Add example L and use it for testing too
- Automate tests and formatting using GitHub actions
- Set of links and temporal nodes at a time t
- Choose between calling nodes temporal nodes or nodes
- Rename test files (?)
- Benchmarking framework
- Change mallocs to the safe macro MALLOC defined in utils.h
- Add a config file for changing the default values and types used (for example slices, to fine tune the memory usage)
- Make sure every function and struct is prefixed with `SGA` to avoid name collisions
- Make sure the .h files are well guarded
- Make sure the .h files are included in the .c files
- Document the code
- Verify key moments between actual others (3.5 ect) and intervals [] or [[ or ]] (best one side open and the other closed [[)
- Find a name for |V|

- Read all the TODOs in the code
