SGA External version 1.0.0

It's used to test that you cannot use a node that is not present for a walk, even if it was present before.

0  -----------------
       {  }    (___)
1  ----{--}---------
       {__}    [___]
2  --------    -----
               {___}
3	       -----
   0   1   2   3   4

Here, to go from 0 to 3 at time 0, you need to go through node 1 at time 3, then node 2 at time 3, then node 3 at time 3.
The algorithm should try to go to node 2 at time 1 to minimise the length, but should not be able to because node 2 disappears at time 2.
